## Setup

- Requires VS2022.
- Unzip the "generatedFiles.zip" folder so all contents are stored in "C:\temp\generatedFiles" (or unzip anywhere you want, change the path in the application to match)
  
## Assignment

- Search the 15,001 files in generatedFiles.zip for the string stored in the _searchValue constant in program.cs; The Program.cs portion must display the names of all the files that contain this string.

Note: The files found only need to be added to the _filesLocated field. The pre-written code will display that for you at the end. The number of files located should be returned by the LocateFilesContainingContent call.
